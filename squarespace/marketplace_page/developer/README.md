# Squarespace Marketplace Site

This is an example of a Squarespace template with custom developer code to integrate Manifold Marketplace widgets.

## How does it work?

We fork a v7.0 Squarespace template ([Avenue](https://www.squarespace.com/templates/avenue-demo)), inject the [Connect Widget](https://docs.manifold.xyz/v/manifold-for-developers/resources/widgets/connect-widget) and the [Marketplace Widget](https://docs.manifold.xyz/v/manifold-for-developers/resources/widgets/marketplace-widgets) code site-wide, add a custom post type, and tell Squarespace's CMS how we want to display said custom post type.

## Changes to SquareSpace Template

### Code injection

We inject Connect and Marketplace Widget JS and CSS in the `head` tag of [`site.region`](./site.region).

### Connect widget in header

[`navigation.block`](./blocks/navigation.block) includes a `div` with the `data-`attributes required for displaying a connect widget. Using the `div`'s id, the injected connect widget is styled in [`connect-widget.less`](./styles/connect-widget.less) (that file is also included in [`template.conf`](./template.conf)'s `stylesheets` array).

### Custom post type definition

We define a custom post type called "Manifold Gallery Listing" so that:

1. we can group the listing ID and network data;
2. it is accessible through the CMS;
3. we can display this post type in a customised way.

We define this type in [`template.conf`](./template.conf)'s `customTypes`' array.

The `manifoldGalleryListing` type:

```json
{
  "title": "Manifold Gallery Listing",
  "name": "manifoldGalleryListing",
  "base": "image",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "listingId",
      "title": "Listing ID",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "network",
      "title": "Network",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "version",
      "title": "Marketplace Version",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "useListingName",
      "title": "Use On-Chain Listing Name",
      "type": "checkbox"
    },
    {
      "name": "useListingDescription",
      "title": "Use On-Chain Listing Description",
      "type": "checkbox"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Custom post type display

The custom post type is included in the `acceptedTypes` array of [`gallery.conf`](./collections/gallery.conf). In [`gallery.list`](./collections/gallery.list), we define how we want to display the `manifoldGalleryListing` type:

```jsont
<div id="slideshow">
  {.repeated section items}
    <div class="slide" data-slide-id="{id}" data-slide-url="{urlId}">
      {.equal? customContent.customType "manifoldGalleryListing"}
        {.section customContent}
          <div data-widget="m-layout-complete-listing" data-id="{@.listingId}" data-network="{@.network}"></div>
        {.end}
      {.or}
        {.image?}
          <img {@|image-meta} data-load="false"/>
          <noscript><img src="{assetUrl}?format=1500w"></noscript>
        {.end}
        {.video?}{@|video}{.end}
      {.end}
    </div>
  {.end}
</div>
```

For this template, `index.list` handles `gallery` collections differently, so we also update [`index.list`](./collections/index.list)'s way of displaying `manifoldGalleryListing` posts.

### Styling

Marketplace widget styling is included in [`marketplace-widget.less`](./styles/marketplace-widget.less) (that file is also included in [`template.conf`](./template.conf)'s `stylesheets` array).

[`site-overrides.less`](./styles/site-overrides.less) includes site overrides.

## Steps
1. Go to your site (we are using the Avenue Template) and click Settings => Advanced => Code Injection. Then activate Developer Mode. You should see a "Connectivity Details" section pop up.
![SQS developer mode config](./images/repo-info.png) <br />
2. Open a new terminal and `git clone <Git Repository link in Connectivity Details>`
3. Now either copy and paste all the code in this repo into the cloned repo or make all the changes found in **Changes to SquareSpace Template** section above. 
4. Then save/push your changes to the repo by doing 
  - `git add -A`
  - `git commit -m "your message"`
  - `git push` 
5. Now go back to your Squarespace site editor and add a new page. You should see a new **Gallery** option in the Collections section. Click it to add a new Gallery page.

6. On the new component on the new page click "Add Images, Videos, or Listings" then click "Manifold Gallery Listing".

7. Click on the section "Manifold Gallery Listing" and fill out the fields with your information. (Network is `1` for Mainnet `5` for Goerli and set Marketplace Version to `2`).
then make sure to click "Save & Publish".

8. Congrats! You should now see your listing on your new gallery page.
